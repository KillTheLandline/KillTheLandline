To comply with industry-standard security practices, we must submit proof to your telephone company that you wish to move your phone number. This must be a <b>picture or copy of a current phone bill</b>. This verifies that it is your phone number and your identity. After we receive your bill, it will take 2-3 weeks for the transfer to complete. We will not bill you or ask for billing information until we confirm the move.

<br />
<span class="label label-important">Important</span> Do not cancel phone service until the transfer is complete.
